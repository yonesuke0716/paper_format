Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare 
autoimmune disorder characterized by ﬂuctuating muscle weakness, loss of tendon reﬂexes, and autonomic dysfunction.1,2 Muscle weakness usually starts in the proximal 
leg muscles,1,3 which can severely limit mobility. Symptoms usually progress over the ﬁrst months and can often be controlled by symptomatic and immunosuppressive treatment.4–6
After diagnosis, symptoms can vary between long-lasting remission on treatment, frequent ﬂuctuations, and permanent disability. Distributions 
of symptoms and signs have been reported in several studies.1,3,7–9 Long-term follow-up of muscle strength scores, EMG, and voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibody results has been reported 
in 47 patients.10
FunctionalimpairmentsofpatientswithLEMSover the disease course have been described in 12 patients only.11
Associated tumors are found in 50% to 60% of patients with LEMS, almost invariably small cell lung cancer (SCLC).1,3,7,12 Limited data suggest some improvement of symptoms in patients with LEMS with SCLC (SCLCLEMS)aftertreatmentofthetumor.13 Previousstudieshave shown a profound improved tumor survival in SCLCLEMS,14–18 but no data exist on the quality of life of this period of improved survival. Hardly any data are available determining survival and quality of life of patients with LEMS without associated tumors.1
In this observational study, we aimed to characterize functional impairments over the disease course and the quality of life of patients with LEMS. We studied survival of all patients with LEMS with and without associated tumors.
Methods Patient population From July 1, 1998, to October 1, 2015, data from all consecutive Dutch patients with LEMS were collected prospectively, as described before.3,19 Leiden University Medical Center has a tertiary neuromuscular outpatient clinic and is the nationwide referral center for LEMS in the Netherlands. Patients were also identiﬁed through diagnosis registration databases and neuromuscular databases in university centers upto2003.Afterward,weapproachedtreatingneurologistsof all Dutch patients with positive results for VGCC antibodies (assay performed in Leiden and Rotterdam for all Dutch hospitals). This resulted in a small number of patients added retrospectivelyafterapositiveVGCCassayandveriﬁcationof
diagnosis (n = 7). One patient with LEMS who lacked most required data was excluded from this study.
The diagnosis of LEMS was based on characteristic clinical features, supported by either the presence of antibodies to VGCC or abnormal decrement and 60% increment on repetitivenervestimulation.2,20Incrementtestingwasperformed immediately after 10 to 30 seconds of voluntary contraction.
Survival In the survival analysis, we separated the patients with LEMS withandwithoutassociatedSCLC,excludingnon-SCLCfrom the analysis (n = 3), as well as 1 patient with SCLC without a knowndateof tumor diagnosis.PatientswithLEMSwithout associated tumor were compared to the general Dutch population as published by the Central Statistics oﬃce of the Netherlands,matchingpatientswithLEMSforageand yearat LEMS diagnosis and sex21 (Statline.cbs.nl22). Survival from diagnosis of tumors in patients with LEMS with associated SCLC was compared to survival in all patients with 
SCLC in the Netherlands from 1998 to 2012, as registered in the Netherlands Cancer Registry Netherlands Cancer Registry operated by Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation.23 As a secondary outcome measure, both patients with SCLC-LEMS and controls with SCLC were compared post hoc according to tumor stage (limited or extensive disease). Among patients with SCLC-LEMS, patients with and those without bulbar involvement or loss of weight within 3 months from onset were compared to show whether these variables predictedsurvival.Survivalofthesepatientswasalsocalculated according to patients’ Dutch-English LEMS Tumour Association Prediction (DELTA-P) scores.24 In patients with followup data, medical events leading up to death were studied to determine their potential relation with LEMS.
Functional impairments Disease course in patients with LEMS was recorded retrospectively with a semistructured interview in all available patients alive in 2014 to 2015 in combination with medical records. We used the modiﬁed Rankin Scale (mRS) and Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) to grade functional impairment. For the mRS, a structured interview was performed.25,26 For a limited number of patients (10 of 63), mRS and KPS scores were collected solely from medical records. In allof thesepatients, extensive follow-updata were available to derive functional limitations.
